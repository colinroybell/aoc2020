# Potential improvements

## General

* Work out how to get VSC to save without whitespace at end of lines.
* Can we get pycodestyle to fix things automatically?

## Day 8

There are various options for solving this in either a more analytic way, or at least not continually rerunning the code from scratch from the beginning. Worth thinking about?

## Day 9

Worth refactoring so we don't rerun bits of code, and
to put the number of steps as an optional variable for testing. The latter is a common paradigm, so want to do it more sensibly.
